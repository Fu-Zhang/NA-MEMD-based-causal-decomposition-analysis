NA-MEMD-based-causal-decomposition-analysis

The code is implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), you can run it through matlab R2017a and higher version。
Signal Processing Toolbox is needed to run the code.

An example is given（example.m）, which calculates the relative causal intensity between two Gaussian white noises by NA-MEMD base causal decomposition method.
You can modify the example code to adapt it to your own data.
